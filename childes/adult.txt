adam now don't bother him anymore
they don't burn it down
don't you think so
if this is a drum and you have these with the drum what do you call those
a kitty's name
robin had a white mouse
will you take those and put them back in the crayon box so they won't get broken
mhm
you mean stop the noise
he went way over there to play by himself
what part of the stove sounds like that
oh
a real one
i don't remember what goes first on the train
oh mhm
nothing
one that crawls around
don't tear her stockings
mhm
it just plays nice music
no you didn't
you hit daddy with the ball and he told you to leave it up there
because that's the way it's made
careful adam
take a guess
to the city of boston
what comes first on the train
a mouse
yes
you had it upside down
it almost went on the block
no what would you call those
from the ocean
alright
can what
yes but you'll hurt her
you have a giant coming through the city of boston
why would you want to break them
no adam
you mean can a building burn down by itself
if you have a drum and you play the drum with these what would you call those
that looks like a mouse
what is that
that's a saddle isn't it
hm
why do you want to shoot him
robin has a little cage for the mouse
a new sixty
you don't like crayons
good
yes if someone starts a fire
what number is that
ride on that
you're going to do what
it turned upside down
that's something you like very much
hm
there's another truck
turn it over
i guess
or if a fire is started in a building and the firemen don't come
what happened to the pilot
oh you do
turn them around
can you ride on that
you'll have_to talk to ursula about that
bunny rabbits also like that
did he fall out
why are you taking him apart
yes a little cage for the mouse
that's pretty good
a sixty rambler
drum sticks
yes you missed it
well he won't like to play with you if you keep doing things like that to him
and what are these
do you know what those numbers are
careful
how do they do what
oh what kind of church is that
to put the fire out
don't run doctor you might fall and hurt yourself
okay
you think that is meat
what is that
these are dragon flies
because he's easier to take care of that way
yes just like the other ones
you are too big
you can't see the cowboy that way
then the building burns down
i think so too
well it could be that way
what kind of meat
alright
you put your foot like the policeman we saw
those are dragon flies
what
now you have_to lead the trucks
a car hit what
you're a boy
it's gonna crash
and who puts it back up

you don't think that's such a good idea
oh brother what
if he didn't go sss like a cat
mary ann
come here
that's to hop on the road
mouth
actually she had such a big week that when she got home last night she was exhausted
never mind

i thought we were gonna share it
mary beth is down there for the summer this year
your alphabets are in your toy box
if he didn't go sss he wouldn't fight
i don't know
last night she was very beautiful
i know somebody that's going to bed real early tonight
oh
right
i have_to laugh at my father
i can't wear the skirt
when it dries out though you won't be able to notice the spots on it huh
they're in the toy box
nine o'clock she had to go to bed
is mommy beautiful
oop
it's too big for mommy
a little
yeah and that says wrong right wrong
she couldn't even keep her eyes open
hey you know that
huh
let me see
mommy's homely though huh
xxx is school
i'd like to guzzle him
if the arrow is over here it's wrong and if it's over here it's right
she had a stomachache and a a headache and
i don't know
i don't think it's gonna fit you honey
huh
please
well she's got ta be related
yyy
i'd like to guzzle him
i think this outfit is too big for you
oh yeah and your back was hurting ya
she has_to be in the burkes or the savages
what's homely mean
she hasn't been going
he spits at the dog and then of course naturally the dog's gonna chase him
if the arrow points there it's wrong
you wanna give melissa her present now
but don't you think mommy's homely
glue
everything was hurting last night huh
the teacher broke the arm that time
i think i'll have_to take it back and buy buy you a dress
a cup of tea
there's only billy sarah and mary ann in the burkes
by the time you walk up three flights of stairs it'll probably be just as bad anyway
and then a couple time there was nobody there
yeah
yeah i guess so
what's homely mean
my father says
that one's from you
huh
that dog is chasing that cat again
don't you think so
somebody else
she hit that pillow and she went out like a light
the weather's better now anyway and she's out playing so i don't bother to send her
that one's from you
pick it up
but the cat is supposed to be only playing
i said
well homely means that a person is not very pretty
didn't ya
that one is from you
what
huh
then the cat'll get up and the poor dog'll just be laying there
yeah
so do you think mommy's homely
i think she's in with the burke family
the day that she goes to bed with ann_marie here she has_to be pretty tired
until she goes to school
childrens_haven
it's a shoulder pocketbook
huh
i think she might be because they look kind of short here
